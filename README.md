Responsive game for kids aged 6 years old to practice maths operations

[Visit the site](http://game-for-pola.herokuapp.com/)

I developed this app for my niece who asked me for tool to practice math operations on smaller and larger groups of numbers. The app was relatively easy to implement, in a familiar tech stack (React), without adding too many features and complicated functionality. However, I truly enjoyed the building process by putting together my design and coding skills. I built an interface that is easy to understand and fun to play with for the kid, and I added some gamification to make the overall learning experience more pleasant by adding points and badges for achievements.

The app is responsive so it can be open on the phone, tablet and desktop. The user can choose maths operations on number 1-12 and 1-18. After navigating to a certain level, the page shows 2-3 “shaken” dice with randomly chosen numbers. The user needs to pick the correct number from the displayed keyboard and is receiving the feedback on the sliding drawer. There is an unlimited number of attempts for incorrect answers, and points for correct answers. By developing this app I could also brush up my skills about React, responsiveness and animation. In the end I could test the app with the real user, and made instant changes based on my observations from how they interact with the game.
